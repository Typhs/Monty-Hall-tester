# Monty-Hall-tester
A test sample generator of the Monty Hall Problem with a manual and automatic iteration system.

This is a simple Python script that tests win probabilities within the Monty Hall Problem. As mathematics confirm, the player's chance of winning is mainly dependant on their choice to switch doors when asked to - when chosen to do so chances of success increase to 2/3, oposing to the alternative which has 1/3 odds. This code is an attempt to, based solely on radomicity, test and confirm this phenomena.
